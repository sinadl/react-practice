# react-practice
This repo contains all my small projects through a certain learning path that i've been taken since the first days of using React.

## Projects:
### 1 - React Quize
<p>The React Quize project contains a json file with name of <em><strong>data.json</strong></em>.<br>
So we use data.json to show questions to the users and to do that I have used these react tools:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>useEffect</li>
    <li>useReducer</li>
  </ol>
In this small project the main focus was on understanding the diffrence between useState and useReducer for managing state of small applications,<br>
so I've handled all states of components with Reducer.
</p>

### 2 - Project 2
<p>to be continued... </p>
